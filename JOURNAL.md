# Scrappy Tail

## Entry 1 - 2025/07/04

USBs are... a complex thing. I decided I want to challenge myself into doing something special with them: a USB Hub. Before I took on this idea and turned it into something, research was definitely needed.

so in the world of growing technology, why go with USB-A when USB Type-C is the norm, the standard nowadays? of course i'm not going for anything crazy like USB 3.0 (or later) - that looks scary, or even thunderbolt :skull:. USB 2.0 was good enough for me, so here we go...

i've sort of had experience with USB Receptacles in KiCAD, but since I was learning how to use EasyEDA Pro Desktop, figured i might as well do it in EasyEDA. unfortunately that means i'll be using whatever symbol the manufacturer of the part is using, unlike the simple symbols in KiCAD, but i'll have to deal with it
